This is a Discord Bot for a specific, unknown, mystery server. It is created to work on one server, because it will disconnect and connect fairly often. Therefore it uses a save configuration function to be able to wake up and restore all the data that was used before. This can serve as an example of using different functions of JDA.

Dependencies:
```
<dependency>
            <groupId>org.yaml</groupId>
            <artifactId>snakeyaml</artifactId>
            <version>2.0</version>
        </dependency>
```
